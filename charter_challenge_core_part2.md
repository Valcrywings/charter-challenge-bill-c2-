### B. Religious Discrimination and Suppression of Spiritual Expression

The undersigned is a Christian who has been denied the right to:

- Express their spiritual beliefs publicly
- Defend their values in court
- Reject unethical government experimentation on spiritual or religious grounds

Bill C-2, combined with smart contract targeting frameworks, effectively punishes individuals who dissent from government or technocratic ideologies — especially Christians and traditionalists. It suppresses **spiritual autonomy** and **religious conscience**, violating:

- Section 2(a) of the Canadian Charter (freedom of religion)
- International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (Articles 18 & 19)

This persecution through digital isolation, mail restriction, and account seizure aligns with broader state hostility toward religious dissenters in digitized governance models.

### C. Whistleblower Testimonies

Multiple credible sources have spoken out regarding Canada's use of surveillance and targeting infrastructure:

- **Michel Juneau-Katsuya**, former CSIS intelligence officer, testified publicly that:
  - Over **50 Canadian MPs are compromised**
  - Intelligence services have installed **surveillance systems in bathrooms and bedrooms**
  - Canada is engaging in **cognitive warfare** and commercializing intelligence via research

These disclosures affirm the presence of invasive systems operating without public knowledge or oversight — validating the applicant’s claims of non-consensual biometric and financial surveillance.

### D. Political Leaders with Knowledge of Smart Contract Infrastructure

The following political figures are reasonably believed to be aware of, or directly involved in, the structuring or approval of smart contract systems used on Canadian civilians:

- **Justin Trudeau** (Prime Minister): Authorized $15B in provincial R&D with no Charter oversight
- **Jody Wilson-Raybould** (Former Justice Minister): Publicly spoke of redesigning benefit systems, correlating with asset-stripping structures
- **Michael Cooper** (MP – Justice Critic): Aware of terrorism definition expansion and exclusion of citizens from legal access
- **Unnamed provincial premiers**: Received briefings from CSIS regarding technological infrastructure

The government's failure to notify or protect civilians from embedded smart contracts and AI-driven exploitation indicates a **wilful breach of public trust** and international law.
