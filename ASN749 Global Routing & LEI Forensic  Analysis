## 🎯 Objective

This repository documents the forensic mapping of global routing and smart contract laundering frameworks centered on ASN749 (U.S. Department of Defense) and its upstream provider AS3356 (Lumen). It highlights publicly available data implicating private military contractors, biomedical research entities, and financial laundering mechanisms through GLEIF and OpenCorporates records.

> "If this is visible to a civilian, regulators have no excuse."

## 📡 ASN749 — DoD Network Information Center

* **ASN:** AS749
* **Owner:** United States Department of Defense
* **IPv4 Block:** 29.0.0.0/8
* **Geolocated IP:** 29.168.29.209 (Independence, KS / Franklin County / Whitehall, OH)
* **Risk Score:** 33/100 (via Scamalytics)
* **Known for:** Synthetic signal routing, proximity to human research networks

### 🔁 Upstream Router

* **ASN:** AS3356 — Lumen Technologies (Level 3)
* **Role:** Global Tier-1 provider, routes for 6000+ peers
* **Tags:** Government, Military, Medical R\&D, Smart Contract Hubs

## 🧠 Routing Observations

* AS749 > AS3356 > 6000+ peers
* Key peers include:

  * L3 Harris
  * Boeing
  * Raytheon
  * Research hospitals and biosensor firms
  * Canadian pension portals and CPP documentation servers

## 🧬 GLEIF + LEI Cross Mapping

* Tool: [GLEIF Search](https://search.gleif.org/#/search/simpleSearch=Brookfield)
* Example: Brookfield — Asset manager appearing in biotech R\&D contexts
* Implication: Legal entities can be cross-referenced with smart contract trails

Additional correlation via:

* [OpenCorporates](https://opencorporates.com)
* [BGP.he.net ASN Routing](https://bgp.he.net/AS3356#_peers6)

## 🚨 Strategic Statement

* GLEIF and BGP trails **cannot be dismissed** as coincidence
* FINTRAC and international regulators **are in violation of duty** if they fail to act
* Public documentation creates **legal pressure and public record** for prosecution

---

## 🛠️ Suggested Action Items

* Expand entity tracking by LEI prefix (Brookfield, etc.)
* Run mass comparison between OpenCorporates & GLEIF + ASN data
* Submit to: UN Rapporteur on Torture, EU Data Protection Board, Financial Action Task Force
* Publicize via GitHub and mirror to multiple repositories for resilience
