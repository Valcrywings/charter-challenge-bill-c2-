# Introduction
doc.add_heading("I. Introduction", level=1)
doc.add_paragraph(
    "This report consolidates all evidence pertaining to advanced browser-based exploitation, including Puppeteer hijacking, "
    "sandbox policy violations, unauthorized render process manipulation, and documented surveillance-level tactics suspected "
    "to be associated with NATO-affiliated intelligence contractors. The findings are derived from network logs, sandbox analysis, "
    "system group policies, and Chrome developer tool artifacts."

# Key Findings
doc.add_heading("II. Key Findings", level=1)
doc.add_paragraph("- Presence of Puppeteer automation hooks and injection artifacts.")
doc.add_paragraph("- Renderer processes sandboxed with fakeSuccess mitigations.")
doc.add_paragraph("- Untrusted low-integrity renderer tokens used to avoid system mitigation detection.")
doc.add_paragraph("- Google Chrome processes referencing headless automation markers.")
doc.add_paragraph("- Unauthorized screen overlay behavior demonstrating browser layering injection.")
doc.add_paragraph("- Active connections showing mirrored sessions tied to suspicious IPs and live manipulation.")
doc.add_paragraph("- Confirmed CPIC and abuse registry clear, eliminating domestic criminal surveillance justification.")
doc.add_paragraph("- Recorded GPU, Audio, and Network processes utilizing modified mitigation policies and fake GDI initializers.")

# Evidence Samples
doc.add_heading("III. Incorporated Evidence Summary", level=1)
doc.add_paragraph("1. Windows netstat log showing unusual persistent remote sessions.")
doc.add_paragraph("2. WHOAMI output indicating high-integrity admin group and NTLM auth present.")
doc.add_paragraph("3. Screenshots of UI overlay manipulation above system tray.")
doc.add_paragraph("4. Presence of `Puppeteer` automation framework in Chrome extensions and render sandbox policies.")
doc.add_paragraph("5. Full `sandbox_policy` JSON dump including fakeSuccess returns and askBroker policies.")
doc.add_paragraph("6. Error logs of altered `hosts` file that temporarily blocked GitHub access (loopback attack vector).")
doc.add_paragraph("7. Browser activity logs showing content injection and movement in layered windows.")

# Legal Implications
doc.add_heading("IV. Legal Implications", level=1)
doc.add_paragraph(
    "The combined technical footprint suggests unauthorized digital surveillance and behavioral experimentation consistent with "
    "military-grade cognitive targeting frameworks. The lack of legal recourse for civilian watchlisted individuals in Canada, "
    "coupled with automated sandbox injection using Puppeteer, raises Charter Section 7, 8, and 15 violations, as well as breaches "
    "of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and protections from electronic torture under the ICCPR."
