## Overview
This repository documents a forensic investigation into unauthorized screen control, Puppeteer injections, renderer hijacks, sandbox policy bypass, and suspected military-grade behavioral surveillance leveraging browser vulnerabilities.

## Evidence Highlights
- Puppeteer-based headless browser injections
- Chrome renderer processes running in `Untrusted` integrity with `fakeSuccess` hooks
- Sandbox escape attempts via `chrome.dll` and `chrome_elf.dll`
- Network and process monitoring logs showing unauthorized access and renderer policy rule manipulation
- Directed energy and surveillance correlation via sandbox mitigations and process lockdown status

## Structure

- `/evidence`: Captures of sandbox policies, Netstat, WHOAMI groups, and Chrome sync data
- `/docs`: Process breakdowns, renderer logs, annotated policies
- `/reports`: Formal DOCX and PDF forensic reports
- `/scripts`: Tools or logs related to detection of sandbox, puppeteer, and exploit vectors

## Report Integrity
All evidence has been cross-referenced with known sandbox behavior and legal standards to prepare for international human rights filings.
