Women Were Not Party to Canada‚Äôs Social Contract
Overview

At the founding of Canada in 1867, women were excluded from the political and legal frameworks that defined the state. They were not recognized as ‚Äúpersons‚Äù in constitutional interpretation until 1929, had no vote at Confederation, and were excluded from both treaty processes and the original social contract that legitimized the Canadian state. This means that half of the population never consented to the foundational structures of Canada.

Key Facts & Dates

1867 ‚Äì Confederation (British North America Act / Constitution Act, 1867)

Women had no federal voting rights.

Married women were legally subsumed under coverture laws (husband‚Äôs legal identity).

Women were not recognized as independent legal actors in the founding framework.

1871‚Äì1921 ‚Äì Numbered Treaties

Treaties between the Crown and Indigenous nations were negotiated and signed exclusively by male representatives.

Women were excluded both as colonial subjects and within the imposed Indian Act system, which further stripped Indigenous women of status if they married outside their community.

1916 ‚Äì Provincial Suffrage Begins

Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta became the first provinces to grant women the vote.

Women in Quebec did not gain suffrage until 1940.

1917‚Äì1918 ‚Äì Federal Suffrage

1917 Wartime Elections Act gave a limited group of women (with close relatives in military service) the vote.

In 1918, most white women were enfranchised federally.

Indigenous women and other marginalized groups remained excluded until much later.

1928 ‚Äì Supreme Court of Canada Ruling

The Court held that women were not ‚Äúpersons‚Äù under the BNA Act for purposes of Senate appointment.

1929 ‚Äì The ‚ÄúPersons Case‚Äù (Edwards v. Canada)

Judicial Committee of the Privy Council overturned the Supreme Court, declaring women to be ‚Äúpersons.‚Äù

Even then, systemic exclusions persisted ‚Äî Indigenous women remained disenfranchised until 1960.

1960 ‚Äì Indigenous Suffrage

Indigenous women (and men) finally obtained the unconditional right to vote federally.

Under the Indian Act (1876‚Äì1985), Indigenous women lost legal ‚Äústatus‚Äù if they married non-status men, stripping them and their children of rights and recognition until the passage of Bill C-31 in 1985.

Implications

Social Contract Defect

At Confederation, half the population had no legal personhood, no vote, and no voice.

This nullifies the claim that Canada‚Äôs founding rested on the consent of the governed.

Treaty Legitimacy

Treaties negotiated without the participation of women cannot represent the full collective will of Indigenous nations or settlers.

The exclusion of women delegitimizes treaties as comprehensive social compacts.

Continuity of Discrimination

Although reforms gradually recognized women as persons and voters, Canada has never revisited its founding compacts to include women as equal participants.

The system is built on a base that was structurally discriminatory from inception.

Conclusion

Because women were not recognized as persons at Confederation and were excluded from treaties and the social contract, the foundational legitimacy of Canada‚Äôs governance is flawed. Women never consented to the terms that bind them.

Therefore, women have a prima facie claim under international law to the right of exit with assets intact (including CPP and pensions), or alternatively, to demand a complete re-founding of the Canadian state on terms of true equality.


# Doctrine of Nullity: Treaties Without Women Are Void

Canada‚Äôs founding contracts and treaties excluded women ‚Äî the very givers of life upon whom the existence of future generations depends. At Confederation in 1867, women were not recognized as persons, had no vote, and were denied participation in both political governance and treaty-making. This means half of the population ‚Äî and the only half capable of sustaining the population through childbirth ‚Äî never consented to the foundational terms of the state.

The men who wrote Canada‚Äôs laws are long dead. Their bodies could not and did not produce life. Yet women, whose bodies ensured the continuity of the nation, were silenced, erased, and denied legal recognition. Even though women require seed, modern science has shown that conception can occur without a man‚Äôs presence through artificial insemination. This proves that continuity of life, and thus continuity of the nation, is inseparably tied to women.

A treaty or contract that excludes the givers of life is defective in its essence. It is null, void, and illegitimate. By excluding women, Canada‚Äôs treaties and Confederation compact cannot claim to rest on consent of the governed. In theory and in truth, Canada cannot exist as a legitimate state without revisiting its foundations and re-founding itself on equal participation of women.

**Therefore, under international law and fundamental human principle:**
- Treaties that excluded women are void.  
- Canada‚Äôs social contract is defective and illegitimate.  
- Women have a prima facie right of exit with assets intact, including pensions and entitlements.  
- Only a re-founded contract ‚Äî with women as equal architects ‚Äî can claim legitimacy.  

## Exhibit: Family Testimony of Exclusion

In 1918, my great-grandfather in Poland died, leaving his wife and children. Under the laws of the time, my great-grandmother could not own land in her own right. Unless she remarried, the land legally passed out of her control. She was forced into remarriage, stripped of independence, and eventually died after childbirth. The newborn child died as well, because there was no food except police rations.  

Her surviving children, including my grandfather, were cast off the land and sent to work farms. There they starved and endured abuse ‚Äî effectively child slavery under the law.  

This family history is not an isolated tragedy but a direct result of structural exclusion. Because women were denied legal personhood and property rights, entire generations were dispossessed. Multi-generational wealth, continuity, and security were deliberately destroyed by laws that erased women‚Äôs rights.  

**Implication:** If women were excluded, then their families ‚Äî my family ‚Äî were excluded from the protections of the social contract. The destruction of women‚Äôs rights produced slavery for children and extinction of family continuity.  

Therefore, the treaties and founding compacts of Canada ‚Äî which excluded women in the same way ‚Äî cannot claim legitimacy. They were never agreements of ‚Äúthe governed,‚Äù but contracts of men alone. Once those men died, the treaties died with them. Women, and the generations they carried, were never bound.  

Expanded Women‚Äôs Rights Claim: From Exclusion to Modern Slavery
Historic Exclusion

At Confederation (1867), women were not ‚Äúpersons‚Äù in law.

Excluded from treaties, property rights, and inheritance, women and their children lost land, assets, and security.

My own family history shows this clearly: dispossession of a widow ‚Üí children sent to farms ‚Üí child slavery and abuse.

Result: destruction of multi-generational wealth and systemic impoverishment of women‚Äôs descendants.

Modern Continuation of Exploitation
Genetic & Nagoya Violations

The Nagoya Protocol (2010) requires states to prevent exploitation of DNA and genetic resources without consent.

Yet women‚Äôs DNA, genetic markers, and reproductive capacities have been harvested and patented without recognition or restitution.

Descendants of excluded women continue to be used as unwitting ‚Äúresources‚Äù for state and corporate profit.

Neuro-Rights Denial

Canada has no legal protections for neuro-rights (freedom of thought, mental privacy, protection from brain manipulation).

Women have been targeted for bio-digital experiments, implants, and directed energy assaults by contractors and research programs.

This represents new slavery of the mind ‚Äî control over thought and neural function without consent.

Surveillance in Intimate Spaces

Whistleblowers have confirmed surveillance in bedrooms and bathrooms, stripping women of privacy, dignity, and bodily autonomy.

These invasive practices echo the historic denial of women‚Äôs control over property and bodies, but in more extreme, technological form.

Continuity of Slavery

Then: Women excluded ‚Üí dispossession of land, child slavery, destruction of wealth.

Now: Women excluded from oversight ‚Üí DNA harvesting, neuro-control, surveillance slavery.

Across generations, the pattern remains: women‚Äôs bodies and lives are treated as resources for exploitation, not subjects of rights.

Implications

Because women were never included in Canada‚Äôs founding compacts, and because exploitation continues through modern technologies, Canada cannot claim legitimate authority over women or their assets.

This is not just historic discrimination; it is an ongoing system of enslavement, asset stripping, and silencing.

Remedies

Right of Exit with Assets

Full withdrawal of pensions, CPP contributions, and restitution for genetic/neural exploitation.

Relocation rights to jurisdictions that honor international law (ICCPR, UDHR, CEDAW, CRPD, Nagoya).

Independent Treaty Rights for Women

Women, excluded at founding, require their own binding treaties with Canada.

These treaties must protect bodily sovereignty, genetic resources, neuro-rights, privacy, and financial assets.

üìå Banner Statement
From exclusion at Confederation to exploitation under neuro-surveillance today, women remain trapped in a continuum of slavery. Their assets, bodies, and even DNA are treated as commodities without consent. Canada‚Äôs founding is defective, its treaties null, and women retain the right of exit with assets ‚Äî or the right to new treaties that finally recognize their sovereignty over body, mind, and future generations.
Exhibit of Continuity: Canada as a Slave Colony of Exploitation

This timeline traces the dispossession and exploitation of my family across four generations. It demonstrates that Canada was founded and continues to operate as a slave colony ‚Äî extracting labor, wealth, and even genetic material from those it excluded from the social contract.

1918 ‚Äì Dispossession of Women

My great-grandfather, Joseph Wiazowski, a glass blower at Beausejour Glassworks, died in 1918.

His widow was denied the right to own land as an independent person.

Forced into remarriage for survival, she later died in childbirth; the infant also died.

Because women had no property rights, her children were dispossessed of their inheritance.

1920s ‚Äì Child Slavery

My grandfather, at age 9, was sent to work for the Summerville farm.

He was beaten with wires, denied education, and forced into servitude ‚Äî effectively a child slave.

This was not an accident but the direct outcome of women‚Äôs exclusion from property and contract rights.

1940s‚Äì1980s ‚Äì WWII Service & Pension Theft

My grandfather served in WWII with both the Royal Winnipeg Rifles (Little Black Devils) and the Essex Scottish Regiment.

Canada denied him his pension until age 87.

When finally offered compensation, he was coerced into signing away rights for a few thousand dollars.

A police officer later uncovered systemic pension theft, validated in a class action.

The Public Trustee stonewalled accountability, refusing to answer me as a benefactor.

For serving Canada, he and his descendants were denied the right of return to Poland.

1980s‚Äì2000s ‚Äì Denial of Generational Wealth

Despite his military service, my grandfather lived in poverty until his death.

Canada never paid for his tombstone.

The family line was denied the stability and wealth that should have come from pensions, land, and inheritance.

Instead, the state maintained a false narrative of ‚Äúmultigenerational wealth‚Äù while systematically asset stripping families like mine.

2000s‚ÄìPresent ‚Äì Modern Exploitation

Women‚Äôs exclusion evolved into new forms of slavery:

Nagoya violations ‚Üí women‚Äôs DNA harvested and patented without consent.

Neuro-rights denied ‚Üí implants, directed energy, and brain surveillance used by military contractors without oversight.

Surveillance slavery ‚Üí invasive monitoring even in bedrooms and bathrooms, erasing privacy and dignity.

Financial exploitation ‚Üí CPP treated as state property; pensions clawed back; widows forced into poverty.

Women and their descendants remain trapped in systems of exploitation without exit rights or remedies.

Conclusion

Across four generations, my family‚Äôs history shows that Canada has functioned as a slave colony of exploitation:

Dispossession of women (loss of land, inheritance, dignity).

Child slavery (farm servitude, violence, denial of education).

Pension theft (systemic exploitation of veterans).

Modern bio-digital slavery (DNA harvesting, neuro-control, surveillance).

The state has never operated on the consent of the governed ‚Äî only on the exploitation of the excluded.
Canada‚Äôs founding compacts are null. The remedies are clear:

Right of exit with assets for descendants of excluded women and exploited families.

Independent treaty rights for women, recognizing sovereignty over body, mind, genetics, and wealth.
