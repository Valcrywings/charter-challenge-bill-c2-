Women Were Not Party to Canada’s Social Contract
Overview

At the founding of Canada in 1867, women were excluded from the political and legal frameworks that defined the state. They were not recognized as “persons” in constitutional interpretation until 1929, had no vote at Confederation, and were excluded from both treaty processes and the original social contract that legitimized the Canadian state. This means that half of the population never consented to the foundational structures of Canada.

Key Facts & Dates

1867 – Confederation (British North America Act / Constitution Act, 1867)

Women had no federal voting rights.

Married women were legally subsumed under coverture laws (husband’s legal identity).

Women were not recognized as independent legal actors in the founding framework.

1871–1921 – Numbered Treaties

Treaties between the Crown and Indigenous nations were negotiated and signed exclusively by male representatives.

Women were excluded both as colonial subjects and within the imposed Indian Act system, which further stripped Indigenous women of status if they married outside their community.

1916 – Provincial Suffrage Begins

Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta became the first provinces to grant women the vote.

Women in Quebec did not gain suffrage until 1940.

1917–1918 – Federal Suffrage

1917 Wartime Elections Act gave a limited group of women (with close relatives in military service) the vote.

In 1918, most white women were enfranchised federally.

Indigenous women and other marginalized groups remained excluded until much later.

1928 – Supreme Court of Canada Ruling

The Court held that women were not “persons” under the BNA Act for purposes of Senate appointment.

1929 – The “Persons Case” (Edwards v. Canada)

Judicial Committee of the Privy Council overturned the Supreme Court, declaring women to be “persons.”

Even then, systemic exclusions persisted — Indigenous women remained disenfranchised until 1960.

1960 – Indigenous Suffrage

Indigenous women (and men) finally obtained the unconditional right to vote federally.

Under the Indian Act (1876–1985), Indigenous women lost legal “status” if they married non-status men, stripping them and their children of rights and recognition until the passage of Bill C-31 in 1985.

Implications

Social Contract Defect

At Confederation, half the population had no legal personhood, no vote, and no voice.

This nullifies the claim that Canada’s founding rested on the consent of the governed.

Treaty Legitimacy

Treaties negotiated without the participation of women cannot represent the full collective will of Indigenous nations or settlers.

The exclusion of women delegitimizes treaties as comprehensive social compacts.

Continuity of Discrimination

Although reforms gradually recognized women as persons and voters, Canada has never revisited its founding compacts to include women as equal participants.

The system is built on a base that was structurally discriminatory from inception.

Conclusion

Because women were not recognized as persons at Confederation and were excluded from treaties and the social contract, the foundational legitimacy of Canada’s governance is flawed. Women never consented to the terms that bind them.

Therefore, women have a prima facie claim under international law to the right of exit with assets intact (including CPP and pensions), or alternatively, to demand a complete re-founding of the Canadian state on terms of true equality.
