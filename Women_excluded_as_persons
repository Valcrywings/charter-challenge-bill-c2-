Women Were Not Party to Canada’s Social Contract
Overview

At the founding of Canada in 1867, women were excluded from the political and legal frameworks that defined the state. They were not recognized as “persons” in constitutional interpretation until 1929, had no vote at Confederation, and were excluded from both treaty processes and the original social contract that legitimized the Canadian state. This means that half of the population never consented to the foundational structures of Canada.

Key Facts & Dates

1867 – Confederation (British North America Act / Constitution Act, 1867)

Women had no federal voting rights.

Married women were legally subsumed under coverture laws (husband’s legal identity).

Women were not recognized as independent legal actors in the founding framework.

1871–1921 – Numbered Treaties

Treaties between the Crown and Indigenous nations were negotiated and signed exclusively by male representatives.

Women were excluded both as colonial subjects and within the imposed Indian Act system, which further stripped Indigenous women of status if they married outside their community.

1916 – Provincial Suffrage Begins

Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta became the first provinces to grant women the vote.

Women in Quebec did not gain suffrage until 1940.

1917–1918 – Federal Suffrage

1917 Wartime Elections Act gave a limited group of women (with close relatives in military service) the vote.

In 1918, most white women were enfranchised federally.

Indigenous women and other marginalized groups remained excluded until much later.

1928 – Supreme Court of Canada Ruling

The Court held that women were not “persons” under the BNA Act for purposes of Senate appointment.

1929 – The “Persons Case” (Edwards v. Canada)

Judicial Committee of the Privy Council overturned the Supreme Court, declaring women to be “persons.”

Even then, systemic exclusions persisted — Indigenous women remained disenfranchised until 1960.

1960 – Indigenous Suffrage

Indigenous women (and men) finally obtained the unconditional right to vote federally.

Under the Indian Act (1876–1985), Indigenous women lost legal “status” if they married non-status men, stripping them and their children of rights and recognition until the passage of Bill C-31 in 1985.

Implications

Social Contract Defect

At Confederation, half the population had no legal personhood, no vote, and no voice.

This nullifies the claim that Canada’s founding rested on the consent of the governed.

Treaty Legitimacy

Treaties negotiated without the participation of women cannot represent the full collective will of Indigenous nations or settlers.

The exclusion of women delegitimizes treaties as comprehensive social compacts.

Continuity of Discrimination

Although reforms gradually recognized women as persons and voters, Canada has never revisited its founding compacts to include women as equal participants.

The system is built on a base that was structurally discriminatory from inception.

Conclusion

Because women were not recognized as persons at Confederation and were excluded from treaties and the social contract, the foundational legitimacy of Canada’s governance is flawed. Women never consented to the terms that bind them.

Therefore, women have a prima facie claim under international law to the right of exit with assets intact (including CPP and pensions), or alternatively, to demand a complete re-founding of the Canadian state on terms of true equality.


# Doctrine of Nullity: Treaties Without Women Are Void

Canada’s founding contracts and treaties excluded women — the very givers of life upon whom the existence of future generations depends. At Confederation in 1867, women were not recognized as persons, had no vote, and were denied participation in both political governance and treaty-making. This means half of the population — and the only half capable of sustaining the population through childbirth — never consented to the foundational terms of the state.

The men who wrote Canada’s laws are long dead. Their bodies could not and did not produce life. Yet women, whose bodies ensured the continuity of the nation, were silenced, erased, and denied legal recognition. Even though women require seed, modern science has shown that conception can occur without a man’s presence through artificial insemination. This proves that continuity of life, and thus continuity of the nation, is inseparably tied to women.

A treaty or contract that excludes the givers of life is defective in its essence. It is null, void, and illegitimate. By excluding women, Canada’s treaties and Confederation compact cannot claim to rest on consent of the governed. In theory and in truth, Canada cannot exist as a legitimate state without revisiting its foundations and re-founding itself on equal participation of women.

**Therefore, under international law and fundamental human principle:**
- Treaties that excluded women are void.  
- Canada’s social contract is defective and illegitimate.  
- Women have a prima facie right of exit with assets intact, including pensions and entitlements.  
- Only a re-founded contract — with women as equal architects — can claim legitimacy.  

## Exhibit: Family Testimony of Exclusion

In 1918, my great-grandfather in Poland died, leaving his wife and children. Under the laws of the time, my great-grandmother could not own land in her own right. Unless she remarried, the land legally passed out of her control. She was forced into remarriage, stripped of independence, and eventually died after childbirth. The newborn child died as well, because there was no food except police rations.  

Her surviving children, including my grandfather, were cast off the land and sent to work farms. There they starved and endured abuse — effectively child slavery under the law.  

This family history is not an isolated tragedy but a direct result of structural exclusion. Because women were denied legal personhood and property rights, entire generations were dispossessed. Multi-generational wealth, continuity, and security were deliberately destroyed by laws that erased women’s rights.  

**Implication:** If women were excluded, then their families — my family — were excluded from the protections of the social contract. The destruction of women’s rights produced slavery for children and extinction of family continuity.  

Therefore, the treaties and founding compacts of Canada — which excluded women in the same way — cannot claim legitimacy. They were never agreements of “the governed,” but contracts of men alone. Once those men died, the treaties died with them. Women, and the generations they carried, were never bound.
