# 🇨🇦 Charter Challenge – Executive Summary

## 📜 What is Bill C-2?

Bill C-2 is a legislative proposal introduced by the Canadian government that expands surveillance, biometric tracking, and financial monitoring under the guise of national security. It seeks to align Canadian domestic policy with U.S.-style counterterrorism models — without equivalent Charter or constitutional protections [1].

This bill would:
- Increase warrantless surveillance and mail interception [2]
- Normalize biometric tracking under financial compliance schemes [3]
- Restrict economic autonomy via smart contract-linked IDs [4]
- Legally bypass consent in bodily autonomy [5]
- Enable unregulated public-private experiments under R&D exemptions [6]

## ❌ Proven Violations and Risks

Evidence from government statements, policy documents, and scientific literature confirm:

- **Violation of Section 7 of the Charter**: Denial of medical access, mobility, and safety of person under bio-surveillance regimes [7]
- **Violation of Section 8 of the Charter**: Covert data harvesting, implant tech, and surveillance without warrants [8]
- **Breach of International Law**: Violates ICC Rome Statute Articles 7, 8, and 18 on torture and inhumane treatment [9]
- **Religious Discrimination**: Policies silence or profile traditional belief systems as “extremism” [10]
- **Weaponization of Public Systems**: DEWs, WBANs, and smart contracts used to injure and monitor without consent [11]
- **Smart Contract Laundering**: FINTRAC confirmed smart contracts fall outside Canadian regulatory oversight [12]
- **Secret Orders in Council**: Research systems embedded without public notice or legal redress [13]

## 📣 Our Demands

We, the citizens of Canada, demand the following:

1. **Suspend Bill C-2 Immediately**  
   No law impacting bodily rights, spiritual integrity, or economic sovereignty shall be passed without full judicial review.

2. **No Summer Law Passage**  
   Bills restricting liberties must not be passed during summer recess or public inaccessibility.

3. **Charter Compliance Review**  
   Surveillance and biomedical policies must be reviewed for constitutional consistency.

4. **Restoration of Medical Access**  
   Citizens must receive full diagnostic access (e.g., RF scans, DEW exposure, implant detection) and retain legal rights to their biodata.

5. **Inquiry into Foreign Influence**  
   Investigate CERN’s White Rabbit timing protocols [14], NATO smart systems, and foreign-originated surveillance algorithms.

6. **Third-Party Oversight**  
   Enable international observers to review Orders in Council, research funding, and biomedical programs.

7. **Reparations for Victims**  
   Establish emergency legal relief and reparations for those subjected to illegal experimentation, denial of service, or asset targeting.

> “No law that impacts every Canadian negatively — economically, physically, spiritually — shall pass without rigorous review, transparency, and public consultation. Financial terrorism and biomedical targeting under secrecy are crimes, not policy.”
