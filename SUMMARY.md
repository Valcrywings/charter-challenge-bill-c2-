# Charter Challenge – Bill C-2

## What is Bill C-2?

Bill C-2 is a legislative proposal in Canada that contains provisions affecting bodily autonomy, data privacy, medical rights, and financial access. It aligns parts of Canadian law with foreign surveillance and data extraction frameworks without adequate public transparency, debate, or protection under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

## Charter Violations Identified

1. **Section 7 – Right to Life, Liberty, and Security**
   - Citizens are being surveilled, experimented on, and denied access to legal and medical services.

2. **Section 8 – Unreasonable Search and Seizure**
   - Surveillance tools, biomedical implants, and body area networks are being used without consent.

3. **Section 2 – Freedom of Religion and Expression**
   - Victims of biometric and AI experimentation are silenced via watchlisting, media control, and targeted discrediting.

4. **Section 15 – Equality Before and Under the Law**
   - People targeted through classified programs are denied access to legal redress or equality in services.

5. **Sections 1 & 33 – Use of Emergency Powers and the Notwithstanding Clause**
   - Laws that override core Charter protections without accountability.

## Key Demands

- Immediate pause on all legislation like Bill C-2 during summer recess or emergency periods without full public and Charter review.
- Transparent investigation into public–private R&D partnerships using non-consensual biodata extraction.
- Removal of secret Orders in Council that bypass citizen consent and legal standing.
- Medical access and RF scan services for victims of directed energy weapons, implants, and illegal experimentation.
- Full restitution of pensions and benefits for affected citizens.
- International oversight if Canadian institutions cannot investigate.
- No foreign-aligned laws that erode Charter rights without public referendum.
