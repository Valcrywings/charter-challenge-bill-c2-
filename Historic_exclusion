# Doctrine of Nullity by Exclusion

From Confederation (1867) to the present, women were excluded from Canadaâ€™s founding contracts, treaties, and property rights. This exclusion destroyed families, erased multi-generational wealth, and continues today through genetic exploitation, neuro-control, and surveillance slavery.

ðŸ“Œ Banner Statement:
*From dispossession of women in 1867 to genetic exploitation today, Canadaâ€™s founding exclusion of women proves the stateâ€™s compacts are defective. Women were never bound, their families enslaved, their assets stripped, and their bodies exploited across generations. The remedy is clear: women must retain the right of exit with assets, or secure their own treaties that protect their sovereignty over life, body, and future.*
# Historic Exclusion of Women

- **1867 Confederation**: Women not recognized as persons, no vote, no treaty role.
- **1871â€“1921 Numbered Treaties**: Negotiated only by men, excluding womenâ€™s voices.
- **Property Laws**: Widows denied land, forced to remarry or dispossessed.
- **Result**: Half the population never gave consent â†’ the social contract is defective.
# Family Testimony: Dispossession and Child Slavery

- My ancestor **Joseph Wiazowski** (glass blower, Beausejour Glassworks) died in 1918.
- His widow could not legally hold land. She remarried under compulsion, died in childbirth, infant also died.
- Surviving children dispossessed, including my grandfather at age 9.
- He was enslaved on the **Summerville farm**, beaten with wires, denied education â†’ a child slave.
- This was not isolated: it was the systemic result of womenâ€™s exclusion from rights and property.
# Continuity of Harm: Loss of Multi-Generational Wealth

- Womenâ€™s exclusion destroyed inheritance rights, erasing family wealth.
- My grandfatherâ€™s servitude illustrates intergenerational poverty.
- CPP and pensions are still treated as state assets, not family entitlements.
- Womenâ€™s descendants remain trapped in systems of asset stripping and poverty.
# Modern Exploitation: Nagoya, Neuro-Rights, and Surveillance Slavery

- **Nagoya Protocol**: Genetic resources should be protected, but womenâ€™s DNA is harvested and patented without consent.
- **Neuro-Rights**: No Canadian legal protections against implants, directed energy, or thought surveillance.
- **Surveillance**: Invasive monitoring in bedrooms and bathrooms strips women of dignity.
- **Result**: Historic exclusion continues as bio-digital slavery of women.
# Doctrine of Nullity

- If women were excluded from Canadaâ€™s founding compacts, then those compacts were never legitimate.
- With male signatories long dead, and with women excluded from continuity, the treaties are extinguished.
- Women, as life-bearers, ensure generational consent. Excluding them nullifies state legitimacy.
# Remedies

1. **Right of Exit with Assets**
   - Full withdrawal of pensions, CPP, generational wealth.
   - Relocation rights with restitution.

2. **Independent Treaty Rights for Women**
   - New compacts negotiated with women as equal parties.
   - Protection of genetic, neuro, financial, and bodily sovereignty.

3. **International Oversight**
   - Invocation of ICCPR, UDHR, CEDAW, CRPD, and Nagoya.
