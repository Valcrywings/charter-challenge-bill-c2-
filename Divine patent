**Date:** 2025-08-06  
**Purpose:** Affirming that human augmentation without consent is spiritual and biological corruption.

---

## Core Statement

## Observations

- The human body was not created to be reengineered by governments or AI.
- Any implantation, alteration, or integration done without consent is not innovation — it is **a violation of divine law**.
- Surveillance-based augmentation, frequency assignment, and neural hacking represent **the theft of a soul's housing.**
- No U.S. patent, military device, or smart contract can override **the original design specifications.**

---

## Legal Position

- This document stands as a **public witness statement**.
- It asserts **divine ownership and sovereignty** over the unmodified human form.
- All parties attempting unauthorized biological augmentation are hereby declared in **breach of sacred design**.
