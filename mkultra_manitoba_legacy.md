# MKULTRA in Manitoba: Canada's Uninvestigated Legacy of Psychological Torture

## Summary

This file documents the origins of MKULTRA experimentation in Manitoba, Canada, and the failure of Canadian authorities to investigate or account for its continuation through modern surveillance and neuromodulation programs. Despite public knowledge of Dr. Ewen Cameron's work in Montreal, his earlier psychiatric experiments in Brandon, Manitoba remain largely unacknowledged and unexplored by formal inquiry. This represents a continued breach of Canada’s obligations under international human rights law and domestic transparency.

## I. The Origin: Dr. Ewen Cameron’s Work in Manitoba

- **Dr. Donald Ewen Cameron** (1901–1967) conducted early psychiatric research at **Brandon Mental Hospital**, Manitoba.
- This work laid the foundation for his later role at the **Allan Memorial Institute (Montreal)**, where MKULTRA mind control experiments were conducted with **CIA and Canadian government funding**.
- Cameron later became **President of the Canadian Psychiatric Association, American Psychiatric Association, and World Psychiatric Association**, indicating elite institutional connections.

## II. Government Complicity and Silence

Despite:

- Public disclosures about MKULTRA,
- Survivor lawsuits (including a Canadian government settlement in 2018),
- FOIA-released CIA documents,

There has **never been a full criminal or parliamentary investigation** into:

- Cameron’s early work in Manitoba,
- Canadian military or intelligence use of psychiatric hospitals,
- The use of public health systems for covert experimentation.

## III. Modern Continuations: From MKULTRA to Neuromodulation

The methodologies pioneered under MKULTRA — isolation, sensory deprivation, neuro-stimulation, and drug testing — are now mirrored in:

- **Wireless Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) research**
- **Directed Energy Weapon (DEW) programs**
- **Implantable semiconductor and smart contract-based surveillance**
- **Use of AI pattern recognition for “behavioral modification”**

These programs are facilitated by **public-private partnerships**, military contractors, and provincial R&D funding (including Trudeau’s $15B commitment).

## IV. Charter and ICC Violations

These actions violate the following:

- **Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms**:
  - Section 7 (Life, liberty, security of the person)
  - Section 8 (Unreasonable search/seizure of body and mind)
- **UN Convention Against Torture** (ratified by Canada)
- **Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC)**:
  - Article 7 – Crimes Against Humanity (torture, persecution, inhumane acts)
- **Nuremberg Code** – banning non-consensual human experimentation

---

## V. Demand for Investigation

We call for:

1. A **full public inquiry** into Brandon Mental Hospital and all records related to Ewen Cameron’s tenure there.
2. Investigation into whether:
   - Techniques from MKULTRA were transferred to other Canadian provinces,
   - Survivors of early experimentation have been silenced or denied care.
3. A **suspension of all public-private surveillance and biometric research programs** using Canadian civilians without informed consent.
