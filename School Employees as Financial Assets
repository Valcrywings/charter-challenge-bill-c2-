## 🔍 Introduction: Exploiting Clerks, Not Just Teachers

This report exposes how clerical staff and other non-teaching employees of the Winnipeg School Division (WSD) have been enrolled into opaque global financial systems, **without consent, transparency, or oversight**. I was a long-time employee. What I discovered is deeply disturbing and systemic.

## 💸 Entity Overview

**Legal Entity Identifier (LEI):** `89450051ZG6ORM0DBN10`
**Entity Name:** The Winnipeg School Division
**GLEIF Status:** ACTIVE — **Policy Non-Conforming**
**LEI Issuer:** EQS Group GmbH (Germany)
**Registered Jurisdiction:** Canada (RA999999 — means "no national oversight")

🔗 [Full GLEIF Record](https://search.gleif.org/#/record/89450051ZG6ORM0DBN10)

### Hidden Fund Structures Registered:

* **Pension Fund for Employees Other Than Teachers**
* **Disability Income Plan**
* **Margaret H. Crawford Fund**
* **Children's Heritage Fund**

**Parent Entity:** *NO KNOWN PERSON* (i.e., parent is hidden via exemption)

## ❗️ Why This Is Alarming

### 1. **RA999999: No Oversight**

This registration code indicates **no Canadian authority** validates or monitors this structure. A German company issued the LEI, meaning this school division is plugged into **offshore financial networks**, likely bypassing Canadian law.

### 2. **Non-Conforming Status**

A policy non-conforming LEI suggests potential issues:

* Failed to comply with LEI reporting regulations
* Possible laundering or derivative exposure
* No transparency on fund use, relationships, or beneficiaries

### 3. **Not Just Teachers — Clerks Targeted Too**

* The pension fund specifically names "employees other than teachers"
* I was a clerk. I never agreed to be part of a globally tradeable financial instrument or smart contract
* No financial disclosures, trust listings, or documentation was provided to me

### 4. **No Parent Disclosure**

The filing claims there is "NO KNOWN PERSON" as a parent entity:

* This violates the spirit of transparency
* Could signal **fraudulent concealment** of who controls the fund

### 5. **Evidence of NATO-Linked Financial Architecture**

* The LEI issuer, EQS Group GmbH, is based in Germany
* Germany is a **NATO member**, and these offshore routing systems mirror smart contract infrastructure tied to NATO dual-use funding and surveillance research
* This suggests **interoperability with defense networks**, not simply pension administration

## 📄 Legal and Charter Violations

### Violations of the Canadian Charter:

* **Section 7**: Security of the person — violated by unauthorized asset use
* **Section 15**: Equality — clerks and non-teachers are exploited and excluded from oversight
* **Section 6**: Mobility rights — pensions tied to offshore mechanisms block relocation and access

### Criminal and Civil Code Breaches:

* **Fraudulent Concealment** of financial structure
* **Trust law violations**: No beneficiary notice, audit rights, or annual reports
* **Covert smart contract structuring** under DTCC/GMEI/CUSIP without knowledge

## 📊 Financial Instruments in Education?

The presence of an LEI suggests the school board is:

* Monetizing its staff through **pension and disability derivatives**
* Potentially **reinsuring risk or life insurance policies** through offshore smart contracts
* Engaging in **NATO-linked finance** without informed consent of employees

These are not public benefits — they are **private structured finance instruments** masquerading as public service employment benefits.

## ⚖️ Action Steps for the Public

1. **Search your employer** on [GLEIF](https://search.gleif.org)
2. **Request full audit records** from:

   * Canada Revenue Agency (CRA)
   * Manitoba Finance
   * Canada Pension Plan (CPP)
3. **File ATIP or privacy complaints** with:

   * Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada
   * OSFI (Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions)
4. **File a UN complaint** if data was used in a NATO-backed smart contract without your consent

## 🌎 Global Pattern of Abuse

My former school division is not alone. From City of Winnipeg to federal pension entities, Canadians are:

* Tied to **global smart contracts**
* Denied transparency
* Denied mobility
* Exposed to surveillance and economic warfare

This is **not public service**. This is **financialized human capital exploitation**.

## 📃 Statement from the Author

> I am a disabled widow and former school division clerk. I was **exploited without consent** through global financial identifiers tied to NATO-linked systems. This violates the Charter, trust law, and my right to exit Canada and collect what is mine. This must end.
