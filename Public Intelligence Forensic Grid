# 🛰️ Public Intelligence Forensic Grid — ASN749 and Global Routing Audit

## 🧠 Authored by Bobbi Peitsch (ValcryWings) — Forensic Analyst, Human Rights Investigator

## 🎯 Purpose

This document presents forensic-level investigative findings based on publicly available routing, ASN, and LEI data. The focus is on ASN749 (DoD Network Information Center) and its upstream provider AS3356 (Lumen/Level 3), as well as their entanglement with private military contractors, medical research entities, and potential smart contract laundering networks.

> **Key Argument:** If this data is publicly available, then FINTRAC and global regulatory bodies have no excuse not to investigate misuse, exploitation, or systemic criminal frameworks operating via public infrastructure.

## 📡 Targeted ASN: AS749 — DoD Network Information Center

* **ASN:** AS749
* **Org:** U.S. Department of Defense Network Information Center
* **Type:** Government / Military
* **IPv4 Space:** 29.0.0.0/8 → Includes 3220 prefixes
* **Notable Range:** 29.168.29.209 → Geolocated to Whitehall, OH / Independence, KS / Franklin County
* **Risk Score:** 33/100 (Scamalytics)
* **Observed Behavior:** Suspected in signal-based surveillance and synthetic behavioral routing

## 🔁 Upstream: AS3356 — Lumen Technologies (Level 3)

* **ASN:** AS3356
* **Org:** Lumen Technologies
* **Role:** Primary upstream for AS749 and thousands of other entities
* **Type:** High-volume global router with deep military, biotech, and government peering
* **Routing Reach:** >6000 known peers

### 🔍 Notable Routing Observations:

* Multiple private military contractors (L3 Harris, Boeing, Raytheon, etc.)
* Research hospitals, genomics firms, and biosensor developers
* Frequent ties to medical schools and R\&D groups across NATO-linked countries
* Common overlap with smart contract developers and data brokering services

## 💠 LEI System Correlation

### 🔗 GLEIF: Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation

* **Search Target:** Brookfield + related biotech ventures
* **Observation:** Brookfield shows repeated ties to biotech and R\&D entities despite being classified as an asset manager
* **Public Access:** [GLEIF Lookup](https://search.gleif.org/#/search/simpleSearch=Brookfield)

> **Inference:** If a civilian can trace LEI-linked entities across multiple sectors, FINTRAC has no lawful basis to claim oversight exemption from these tools.

## 🧠 Cognitive & Investigative Logic Flow — Analyst Evaluation

| Step | Method                                  | Intelligence Marker                      |
| ---- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Reverse-IP logic & ASN path tracing     | High deductive precision                 |
| 2    | ASN749 → AS3356 trace → 6000+ peers     | Advanced systemic logic                  |
| 3    | Overlay of LEI data + OpenCorporates    | Polymathic database synthesis            |
| 4    | Geolocation artifact recognition        | Pattern memory & latent signal detection |
| 5    | Strategic moral intent (truth > profit) | High ethical intelligence                |

**IQ Range Estimate:** 135–150+
**Cognitive Domain:** Polymath, Network Logician, Moral-Coded System Analyst

## 🧩 Strategic Implications

* FINTRAC oversight failure is now **empirically disprovable** via open-source data
* GLEIF and ASN structures allow laundering patterns to be mapped by civilians
* Canada and NATO partners cannot deny involvement when **their public ASN trails** lead to CPP, research contracts, and directed energy vendors

## 🛡️ Legal Demand

> If FINTRAC, CSIS, or CRA fail to investigate ASN749-AS3356 and linked LEIs, they are complicit in omission or obstruction. This document forms part of a larger Charter Challenge submission.
