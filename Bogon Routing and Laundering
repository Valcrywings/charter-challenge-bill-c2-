# 🕳️ Bogon Routing and Laundering: Tracking Hidden ASN Traffic and Offshore Smart Contracts

## 🌎 Overview: What Are Bogon IPs?

**Bogon IPs** refer to IP address ranges that are **unassigned or reserved** by IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority). They should never be visible on the public internet.

However, these IPs are often **misused for covert operations**, including:

* Money laundering via smart contracts
* Offshoring of assets
* Signal routing for surveillance or biometric harvesting
* Experimental medical or military web infrastructure

## 🔒 Core Discovery: 0.0.0.2 — Dog Breeding Cover Site

One of the earliest known incidents discovered by the author was a dog breeding website hosted on `0.0.0.2`.

> “This was tracked years ago. It looked benign. But something felt off. When I traced it, the routing path tied into military domains. It was likely a behavioral front.” — *Bobbi Peitsch*

* **Domain:** Dog breeding service (now offline)
* **IP:** 0.0.0.2 (should not be routable)
* **Routing Behavior:** ASN masking, military connection, anomalous DNS responses
* **Cover Purpose:** Behavioral data collection / laundering shell

## 🚀 Mechanism of Abuse

| Stage | Activity       | Description                                     |
| ----- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | IP Hijack      | Bogon IPs are routed using BGP manipulation     |
| 2     | Fast-Flux DNS  | Domains point to rotating IPs to evade tracking |
| 3     | Hosting Shell  | Websites or smart contract nodes deployed       |
| 4     | Asset Flow     | Crypto or fiat routes through ASN tunnels       |
| 5     | Dump and Shift | IP reassignment occurs; logs vanish             |

## 🌐 Tools to Trace

* [HE.net BGP Tool](https://bgp.he.net/)
* [Scamalytics](https://scamalytics.com/)
* [Gleif.org LEI Directory](https://search.gleif.org)
* [OpenCorporates](https://opencorporates.com/)
* [IANA Bogon List](https://www.iana.org/assignments/iana-ipv4-special-registry/iana-ipv4-special-registry.xhtml)

## 🚨 Why It Matters

* **Smart Contract Laundering:** Transactions tied to biometric or genetic exploitation are routed via these channels.
* **Unregulated Surveillance:** These IPs host tracking layers, data collection, and even spoofed medical systems.
* **Military-Private Crossflow:** Tied to contractors, AI networks, and R\&D programs outside civilian jurisdiction.

## 📊 Legal and Ethical Implications

* **FINTRAC Oversight Failure**: These IPs are accessible to the public yet are "ignored" in enforcement audits.
* **Violation of IANA Policy**: Use of bogons for laundering breaches global internet governance.
* **Human Rights Threat**: Weaponized data trails routed through hidden tunnels impact civilians worldwide.
