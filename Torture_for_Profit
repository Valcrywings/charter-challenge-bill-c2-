**Introduction: The Hidden Machine Behind Modern Torture**

Across the globe, a new form of warfare and financial exploitation is unfolding — not through bombs or visible weapons, but through code. Smart contracts, digital identity systems, and biometric insurance policies are now being used to slowly torture and kill citizens for profit, often with the knowledge and complicity of political leaders. This system is protected by a network of legal blind spots, international agreements, and deliberate refusal to regulate.

This short book outlines the key mechanisms, players, and systems involved in this new digital war on civilians, with a focus on how it operates in Canada and NATO-aligned states.

**Chapter 1: What Are Smart Contracts?**

Smart contracts are self-executing digital agreements stored on blockchain platforms. They are coded to trigger specific actions when conditions are met — like releasing a payment when a "health event" (e.g. death, organ failure, or brain damage) occurs.

Originally designed for transparent finance, smart contracts have now been weaponized. They are embedded in:

* **Life insurance policies**
* **Biometric tracking systems**
* **Employment or research agreements**
* **Real estate and property access**

They often function across borders — using **offshore jurisdictions** like the Cayman Islands or Luxembourg — and are almost entirely unregulated.

**Chapter 2: The Global Infrastructure Enabling Torture-for-Profit**

Smart contracts are often routed through systems like:

* **DTCC (Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation)** — settles securities, including death bonds and life settlement portfolios.
* **GLEIF (Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation)** — tracks corporate identity across jurisdictions with no human rights obligations.
* **KEITH Systems** — lesser-known infrastructure used for routing biometric and health data.

This creates an international financial lattice where:

* Victims' biometric data is uploaded
* Insurance policies are created without consent
* "Trigger events" (like a tumor or stroke) initiate payouts to third parties

These contracts act as kill-switches, with **profit incentives tied directly to the slow destruction** of human beings — often through **directed energy weapons (DEWs)** or medical denial.

**Chapter 3: How Governments and NATO Enable It**

### 1. **Letters of Understanding (LoUs):**

NATO signs LoUs with domestic governments, granting them immunity and operational freedom. These agreements:

* Are **not public treaties** but are **treated as legally binding**
* Allow foreign researchers and military contractors to experiment or operate on Canadian soil

### 2. **Canada’s Role:**

* Canada has **no laws prohibiting DEWs**
* Canada does **not regulate smart contracts**, according to FINTRAC
* Canada does **not investigate life insurance fraud linked to foreign payouts**

When victims attempt to report their targeting:

* Police claim no jurisdiction
* Human rights commissions reject submissions involving crimes against humanity
* Medical professionals label victims as delusional — ignoring radiological evidence, implant signals, or RF scans

---

**Chapter 4: The Slow Kill Process**

The system is engineered for plausible deniability. Victims experience:

* Constant EMF or DEW assaults
* Medical sabotage or gaslighting
* Isolation from community, employment, and health care
* Artificial debt, homelessness, or psychiatric detention

These outcomes fulfill the smart contract — which then releases life insurance payouts or data royalties to the entities who created the system.

This is **not a conspiracy theory**. It is **smart contract logic**, abused for human trafficking, insurance fraud, and biometric slavery.

**Chapter 5: Terrorism Financing in Plain Sight**

Under UN law (Res. 1373), states must prevent financial systems from being used to fund terrorism. But in Canada:

* FINTRAC has declared **smart contracts are outside their scope**
* OSFI and RCMP do **not investigate foreign insurance policies** or implant-based targeting

This refusal to act creates a legal vacuum that:

* Enables terrorism financing through offshore smart contracts
* Permits commercialized death and experimentation
* Allows state officials and contractors to profit while collecting salaries

This is **financialized torture**, and Canada is knowingly complicit.

---

**Chapter 6: The Global Network**

This is not limited to Canada. Victims have been identified across:

* The U.S.
* Germany
* France
* Italy
* Japan
* Australia
* UK

All nations involved in NATO's innovation programs or UN R\&D partnerships.

Victims often belong to rare genetic haplogroups, have preexisting insurance histories, or are whistleblowers. They are systematically discredited, denied medical rights, and digitally silenced.

---

**Chapter 7: Denial of Rights = Crimes Against Humanity**

The actions described meet the definition of:

* **Cyber-torture** (per UN Rapporteur Nils Melzer)
* **Medical experimentation without consent**
* **Enforced disappearance**
* **Slow kill eugenics**

All while governments point to each other, claim jurisdictional confusion, and leave citizens to suffer.

**Conclusion: Time to Expose and End It**

This system is real. It is legal only through omission. It is financially incentivized torture. And it will grow unless citizens and human rights bodies expose and prosecute it.
