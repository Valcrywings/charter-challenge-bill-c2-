# 🛰️ Shadow Financial Asset Investigation Toolkit  
### How to Track Offshore Holdings, Smart Contracts & Payment Island Structures Tied to You  

This guide provides a step-by-step method to trace **financial instruments**, **offshore trusts**, and **tokenized assets** that may have been created using your:

- Social Insurance Number (Canada) or Social Security Number (U.S.)
- Legal Name
- Home or Property Address
- Biometric or Medical Data
- Deceased Spouse or Family Member’s Identity

If you suspect your value is being used in **"Payment Island" fraud schemes** (e.g., Cayman Islands, Isle of Man, BVI), or your house is being **tokenized or collateralized**, start here.

## 🧭 Step-by-Step Investigation Plan

---

## 🔹 STEP 1: Search Legal Entity Identifiers (LEI / GMEI)

Used to create global financial instruments (e.g., annuities, death-benefit contracts, derivatives).

- 🔍 [GMEI Utility Search](https://www.gmeiutility.org/)
- 🔍 [GLEIF LEI Search](https://www.gleif.org/en/lei/search/)
- 🔍 [OpenCorporates – Company Database](https://opencorporates.com/)

> Search:
> - Your full legal name  
> - Your deceased spouse’s name  
> - Your address  
> - Known aliases or prior names  

---

## 🔹 STEP 2: Check OFAC and Sanctions Watchlists (U.S. Treasury)

If you are tied to a blocked or flagged financial structure, you may appear here.

- 🔍 [OFAC Sanctions List Search](https://sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov/)
- 🔍 [EU Sanctions Map](https://www.sanctionsmap.eu/#/main)

---

## 🔹 STEP 3: Investigate CUSIP / CINS Derivatives (Security Identifiers)

Used by:
- DTCC (Depository Trust & Clearing Corp)
- BlackRock
- Insurance/pension backers

Public search is limited — but ask a broker, FOIA, or legal request for:
> “Any CUSIP, CINS, or LEI instrument linked to [your address / name / SIN / SSN] or to trusts registered in offshore jurisdictions.”

## 🔹 STEP 4: Search Blockchain Tokenization (Smart Contract Abuse)

Your identity or home may have been:
- Tokenized (e.g., NFT, REIT, fractional home ownership)
- Used in smart contract-backed securities
- Linked to real estate held in offshore wallets

Check:

- 🔍 [Etherscan – Ethereum Blockchain Explorer](https://etherscan.io/)
- 🔍 [RealT – Tokenized Real Estate](https://realt.co/)
- 🔍 [Propy – Smart Deeds](https://propy.com/)
- 🔍 [tZero](https://www.tzero.com/)

Search:
- Your address
- Name
- Transaction hashes or aliases (if known)

---

## 🔹 STEP 5: File FOIA / CRA / FINTRAC Requests (Fraud & Cross-Border Tracking)

### Canada (CRA / FINTRAC)
- 🔗 [CRA ATIP Request](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/about-canada-revenue-agency-atip/submit-access-to-information-privacy-request.html)
- 🔗 [FINTRAC Contact](https://fintrac-canafe.canada.ca/contact-eng)

Request:
> “All STRs, T3 slips, pooled retirement funds, annuities, or international transfers associated with my SIN or property.”

### U.S. FOIA Targets
- 🔗 [IRS FOIA](https://www.irs.gov/foia)
- 🔗 [Social Security FOIA](https://www.ssa.gov/foia/)
- 🔗 [FinCEN Tip Submission](https://www.fincen.gov/contact)

- 🇧🇻 British Virgin Islands (BVI)
- 🇰🇾 Cayman Islands
- 🇮🇲 Isle of Man
- 🇸🇨 Seychelles
- 🇬🇬 Guernsey / 🇯🇪 Jersey
- 🇸🇬 Singapore

## 📎 Sample Query Text for Requests:

> I am requesting full records of any financial instruments, smart contracts, trusts, reinsurance products, or pooled annuities that have used my personal data, home address, or Social Insurance/Security Number as a basis for issuance or collateralization.  
>  
> This includes any reporting to or through jurisdictions associated with tax shelters, payment islands, or foreign reinsurance pooling systems.

## 🧷 Pro Tip: Track Patterns Across Systems

Use the following identifiers:
- Your full legal name (past and present)
- Your deceased spouse's name and SIN/SSN
- Home address or land parcel ID
- Keywords: "trust", "annuity", "GMEI", "REIT", "smart contract", "tokenized", "reverse mortgage", "collateral"
