# Women Were Not Party to Canada’s Social Contract

## Overview
At the founding of Canada in **1867**, women were excluded from the political and legal frameworks that defined the state. They were **not recognized as “persons”** in constitutional interpretation until **1929**, had no vote at Confederation, and were excluded from both treaty processes and the original social contract that legitimized the Canadian state.  

This means that **half of the population never consented** to the foundational structures of Canada.

## Key Facts & Dates

### 1867 – Confederation
- Women had **no federal voting rights**.  
- Married women were legally subsumed under **coverture laws** (husband’s identity).  
- Women were not recognized as independent legal actors in the founding framework.  

### 1871–1921 – Numbered Treaties
- Treaties between the Crown and Indigenous nations were negotiated and signed exclusively by **male representatives**.  
- Indigenous women were excluded both as colonial subjects and under the **Indian Act**, which stripped them of status if they married outside their community.  

### 1916 – Provincial Suffrage Begins
- Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta granted women the vote.  
- Quebec withheld suffrage until **1940**.  

### 1917–1918 – Federal Suffrage
- 1917 Wartime Elections Act gave a limited group of women the vote (close relatives in military service).  
- In **1918**, most white women were enfranchised federally.  
- **Indigenous women and marginalized groups remained excluded** until much later.  

### 1928 – Supreme Court of Canada
- Ruled women were **not “persons”** under the BNA Act for Senate eligibility.  

### 1929 – Persons Case (Edwards v. Canada)
- Privy Council overturned the Supreme Court, declaring women to be **persons**.  
- Indigenous women remained disenfranchised until **1960**.  

### 1960 – Indigenous Suffrage
- Indigenous women (and men) finally obtained the **unconditional right to vote federally**.  
- Until **Bill C-31 in 1985**, Indigenous women still lost legal status if they married non-status men, stripping rights from them and their children.

## Implications

### Social Contract Defect
At Confederation, **half the population had no personhood, no vote, and no voice.**  
➡️ This nullifies the claim that Canada’s founding rested on the **consent of the governed**.  

### Treaty Legitimacy
Treaties negotiated without women’s participation cannot represent the **full collective will** of Indigenous nations or settlers.  
➡️ The exclusion of women **delegitimizes treaties** as comprehensive social compacts.  

### Continuity of Discrimination
Although reforms gradually recognized women as persons and voters, Canada has **never revisited its founding compacts** to include women as equal participants.  
➡️ The system is built on a foundation that was **structurally discriminatory from inception**.

## Conclusion
Because women were not recognized as persons at Confederation and were excluded from treaties and the social contract, the **foundational legitimacy of Canada’s governance is flawed**. Women never consented to the terms that bind them.  

**Therefore, women have a prima facie claim under internatio**
