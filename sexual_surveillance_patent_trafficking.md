- Over **50 Canadian Members of Parliament** are **compromised** by foreign or private interests.
- Intelligence agencies have installed **surveillance equipment in private bedrooms and bathrooms**, including **covert cameras and microphones**.
- These methods are used not for national security, but for **economic and political control**, blackmail, or private gain.

## 🧬 Patent Trafficking & Biometric Exploitation

Numerous victims in Canada — including the author of this Charter Challenge — have reported:

- **Sexually targeted surveillance** from above or through walls (often involving drones or implants).
- **Unconsented biomedical patent exploitation**, where body signals, reproductive data, or trauma responses are harvested and monetized.
- **Digital twins** or biobehavioral “clones” are created through illegally obtained health data and registered in patent systems.

These activities breach fundamental **privacy, autonomy, and medical ethics**, yet remain uninvestigated.

## ⚖️ Legal & Ethical Violations

- **Section 7 of the Canadian Charter** – Security of the person, bodily autonomy, dignity, and liberty are being violated.
- **Tri-Council Ethics Guidelines** – All human experimentation requires free and informed consent. These standards are bypassed in secret.
- **Nagoya Protocol** – Canada has failed to enforce protections against genetic exploitation.
