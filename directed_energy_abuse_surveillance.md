# üî¶ Directed Energy Weapons, Surveillance & Crimes Against Humanity

## üö´ Legal Vacuum in Canadian Criminal Code

Canada does **not** currently recognize Directed Energy Weapons (DEWs), Plasma Energy Weapons (PEWs), or Kinetic Energy Weapons (KEWs) in its **Criminal Code** as tools of warfare, organized crime, or systemic abuse. This lack of legal definition allows for covert use without legal investigation.

Canadian Criminal Code:  
[https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-46/](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-46/)

> üî¥ **Organized crime** provisions under Section 467.1‚Äì467.12 make no mention of electromagnetic, acoustic, or radiological weapons as instruments of systemic torture.

## üß¨ Human Targeting via Remote Systems

Victims report assaults via:
- **Ionizing & non-ionizing radiation** (e.g., microwave)
- **Infrasound & ultrasound**
- **Frequency-based neural interference**
- **Body Area Network (BAN) systems**
- **Implanted semiconductors and nanowire networks**

Canada has **no public testing protocols** for these. Hospitals refuse to scan for:
- Heavy metal particulates
- Neuromodulation implants
- Non-thermal radiation impact

## üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Secret Orders in Council & Abuse of Authority

Under **Secret Orders in Council**, local and federal police may be working under military coordination with private contractors. This removes transparency and accountability, violating:

- **Charter Section 7** (life, liberty, and security)
- **Charter Section 8** (unreasonable search/seizure)
- **Charter Section 12** (cruel and unusual punishment)

## üìú ICC & International Violations

Canada is a **signatory to the UN Convention Against Torture** and the **Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC)**, yet these weapons qualify under:

- **Article 7: Crimes against humanity**
- **Article 8: War crimes involving use of prohibited weapons**
- **Article 12: Jurisdiction over territory and nationals**

## üß† MKULTRA & Medical Weaponization History

Canada participated in **MKULTRA** in partnership with the CIA, testing:
- LSD
- Sleep deprivation
- Electromagnetic and neurological trauma

This was conducted at **Allan Memorial Institute** under Dr. Ewen Cameron. Victims were never fully compensated.

## üìé Summary

Canada is operating in a legal and medical vacuum that allows systemic torture and soft-kill impairment of civilians using unregulated military and research technology. Without clear criminal law, investigatory protocols, or informed consent protections, these practices violate both the **Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms** and multiple international treaties.

This section demands that:
1. Directed energy weapons be criminalized.
2. Civilian complaints be investigable under law.
3. Independent international review bodies be granted access to Canada.
4. Historical abuses such as MKULTRA be transparently reconciled.
