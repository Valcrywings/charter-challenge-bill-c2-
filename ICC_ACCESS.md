## ICC Access Barriers and Canada's Treaty Failures

While Canada is a state party to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC), it **refuses to provide public access mechanisms** to uphold the treaty’s obligations. The ICC permits individuals to submit complaints (Rome Statute Article 15), but **requires either prosecutorial failure** or **evidence of systemic impunity**.

Victims of:
- Unconsented medical experimentation
- Directed energy attacks
- Surveillance-based targeting
- Genetic or biometric exploitation through smart contracts

...are **denied access to evidence, medical diagnostics, legal representation, and investigation channels**.

### Canadian Failures Include:
- **No avenue for independent investigation** into NATO-aligned private contractors.
- **Law societies block representation** for citizens labeled under security narratives.
- **Police refuse to investigate** high-level crimes under the guise of national security or partnerships.
- **No formal mechanism** for public ICC referrals, despite treaty obligations.
- Women and disabled individuals are **disproportionately affected**, especially in research, real estate seizures, and social discrediting.

### Why This Meets ICC Criteria:

Under **Article 17 of the Rome Statute**, the ICC has jurisdiction when a state:
- Is "unwilling or unable genuinely to carry out the investigation or prosecution."
- Uses national mechanisms to **protect perpetrators** instead of victims.

This applies directly to Canada’s practices:
- Denial of medical scans for evidence of implants.
- Suppression of court-admissible evidence of RF exposure and targeting.
- Financial gatekeeping of constitutional rights through legal cost barriers.

> This submission establishes Canada as *functionally unwilling* to prosecute or investigate crimes under ICC jurisdiction.

### Demand:

We call for an **Article 15 referral by the ICC Prosecutor**, supported by a **civilian-sourced legal dossier** — documenting crimes against humanity occurring on Canadian soil under false pretenses of public safety and research.
