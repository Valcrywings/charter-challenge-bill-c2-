### Psychological Torture
Intentional infliction of **severe mental suffering**, even without physical pain, under Article 1 of the UN Convention Against Torture.  
[UNCAT Full Text](https://www.ohchr.org/en/instruments-mechanisms/instruments/convention-against-torture-and-other-cruel-inhuman-or-degrading)

### Cybertorture
In Section III.E, Melzer defines "cybertorture" as:  
> "The deliberate use of cybertechnology for the purpose of inflicting severe mental or physical suffering." 

This includes **remote harassment, surveillance, V2K (voice-to-skull), and electromagnetic attacks**.

### Implants & Neurotechnology
Explicitly addressed in the report as emerging risks. Misuse of **implants, neural devices, and cybernetic hardware** could be weaponized to exert control, pain, or degradation.
