## üß¨ Smart Contracts and Financial Infrastructure Lacking Oversight

This Charter Challenge highlights a foundational flaw in the structure of Canada's financial oversight regime: **no existing authority governs or audits the smart contracts used to monetize biometric and personal data**.

---

### üîç Key Infrastructure Entities and Their Oversight Gaps

#### 1. **GLEIF (Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation)**
- Governs the issuance of **LEIs (Legal Entity Identifiers)** used in smart contract ecosystems.
- Not accountable to Canadian civilian law or constitutional protections.
- Often linked to offshore or anonymized blockchain activity.
- Website: [https://www.gleif.org](https://www.gleif.org)

#### 2. **DTCC (Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation)**
- A central clearinghouse for global securities, including **CUSIP numbers** used to bundle smart contracts.
- Operates transnationally with **no Canadian civilian review or Charter compliance**.
- Enables institutional packaging of digital identities or contracts.
- Website: [https://www.dtcc.com](https://www.dtcc.com)

#### 3. **CUSIP Global Services (CGS)**
- Issues **CUSIP identifiers** for financial instruments, including data-linked derivatives.
- These identifiers can be linked to data packets, contracts, and tokens tied to human behavior or biology.
- Website: [https://www.cusip.com](https://www.cusip.com)

#### 4. **LEIs (Legal Entity Identifiers)**
- These are required to interact with global financial systems via smart contracts.
- Civilians have no ability to revoke, audit, or remove themselves from entities tagged to their biometric or personal records.
- Often embedded invisibly in systems tied to insurance, pensions, and private databases.

### ‚ùó Oversight Failures

Despite the deep integration of smart contracts into health, finance, and biometric data routing:

- **FINTRAC has confirmed it does not monitor smart contracts**
- **No public body audits LEIs or CUSIP usage in Canadian civilian data applications**
- **DTCC and GLEIF operate with foreign sovereignty and are not answerable to Canadian privacy or Charter protections**

This constitutes a complete **legal vacuum**, allowing:
- Identity trafficking through financial instruments
- Monetization of health and surveillance data
- Asset stripping via non-transparent algorithms
- Denial of due process for targeted individuals
