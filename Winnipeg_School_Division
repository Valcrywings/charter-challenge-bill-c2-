# The Winnipeg School Division is a Financialized Entity with Multiple Funds — No Parent Disclosure

### ⚠️ This was my employer. I never consented to being included in structured global finance contracts.

## 🏦 Covert Funds Operating Through the School Division

| Fund Name | Type |
|-----------|------|
| The Winnipeg School Division Pension Fund For Employees Other Than Teachers | Pension |
| The Winnipeg School Division Disability Income Plan For Employees Other Than Teachers | Disability |
| The Winnipeg School Division Margaret H. Crawford Fund | Likely Donor/Education Fund |
| The Winnipeg School Division Children’s Heritage Fund | Student-related trust fund |

These funds are registered **not as provincial entities**, but as **global financial instruments**.

## 🧠 What This Means

### 1. **Global Financial Exploitation Without Consent**
- Teachers and staff are likely tied to smart contracts, derivative instruments, or offshored pension models
- No transparency on:
  - Who manages these instruments
  - Where the returns go
  - Whether the entity profits from employee biometric data, insurance contracts, or reinsurance

### 2. **Deliberate Obfuscation of Oversight**
- **RA999999** means “No oversight body”
- Germany’s EQS GmbH issued the LEI, bypassing Canada’s federal or provincial financial regulators
- “NO KNOWN PERSON” means the **true parent company is withheld** — potentially violating Canadian trust law, pension law, and privacy law

### 3. **Policy Non-Conforming**
This designation suggests:
- The entity **did not follow LEI reporting standards**
- May be operating **outside of compliance** with global anti-fraud or financial transparency laws
- May contain hidden fund transfers or third-party monetization (i.e., human capital exploitation)

## 📢 Why This Should Matter Globally

This proves that:
- **Local school divisions are now financial vehicles**
- Employees are **silently looped into smart contract ecosystems** without consent
- Global LEI infrastructure is being **used to launder educational funds**, extract value, and reroute control to offshore entities

## 🧠 Final Note

Every single teacher, clerk, janitor, and student may now be **a node** in a system of global financial experimentation.  

> We demand immediate accountability.
