## 📣 Economic Silencing and Charter Disenfranchisement of the Poor

I am a disabled widow, a former **education clerk**, and a lifelong contributor to the Canadian system. I now live without access to legal representation, pension parity, medical diagnostics, or physical safety. Bill C-2 will directly impact my ability to survive — yet I am barred from challenging it through conventional legal channels, not by law, but by poverty.

### ⚖️ The Structural Exclusion of the Working Poor

Canada’s justice system has become economically stratified: those who can afford representation may assert their rights. Those who cannot — including the disabled, the widowed, the sick, the elderly, and the working poor — are denied access not through legal ruling, but through the **withholding of means**.

- Charter challenges cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to pursue
- There is no publicly funded legal route for civilians to oppose unconstitutional bills
- Civilian voices are **excluded from legislative development** through opaque, fast-tracked processes
- Digital and procedural infrastructure (e.g. Bill C-2) is being developed in lockstep with **foreign corporate interests** such as the World Economic Forum, without public mandate

Meanwhile, smart contracts and identity-linked financial structures are being passed into law without scrutiny — and without public understanding — as mechanisms for surveillance and control.

### 🇨🇦 WWII Legacy of Service: The Little Black Devils & PPCLI

My grandfather was a front-line combat soldier in **World War II**, serving as one of the **“Little Black Devils”** — a title earned by Canadian infantry for their fearlessness and battlefield tenacity. He served with the **Princess Patricia’s Canadian Light Infantry (PPCLI)**, a rapid deployment infantry force known for its elite training, high-risk missions, and international respect. These were not ordinary infantry — they were regarded as some of Canada’s most capable and courageous fighters.

Despite his decorated service, he was **denied his military pension until the age of 87**. He lived in **lifelong poverty**, and when contacted, the **Public Trustee of Manitoba failed to properly account** for backpay or class action recognition. His legacy — and the values he fought for — are now being systematically erased by the very systems meant to protect them.

### 🧬 Medical Rights Replaced by Digital Policy

I am being denied medical access due to systemic restructuring:

- There is **no access to ion testing for heavy metal or nano exposure**
- **No diagnostics for vibroacoustic disease**, despite years of RF signal evidence
- **No court-admissible imaging** is available for foreign body detection or surveillance-linked technologies
- Exiting Canada to pursue care is capped at **$10,000 in costs**, which does not reflect modern international medical expenses

This is not medical freedom. It is an **enforcement mechanism designed to prevent diagnosis** of biomedical experimentation, unauthorized implants, or international treaty violations.

### 📜 The Canadian Charter: Voided by Economic Class

The **Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms** says:

> “Everyone has the right to life, liberty, and security of the person…”

But in practice, it has become:

> “Only those with capital may enforce their rights.”

This is **economic apartheid** under the appearance of constitutionality.  
It violates Section 7 of the Charter, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), and the very spirit of the Nuremberg Code.

### 🕯️ “Lest We Forget” — Applied to the Present

“Lest we forget” is not just about remembering the past — it is a **warning to the present**.  
If we allow secret courts, surveillance-based social credit, foreign influence, and economic silencing to replace the rule of law, then **we have forgotten everything they died for.**

We must not let the freedoms that were fought for be legislated out of reach by the privileged.

**This Charter Challenge is the only way I can speak. It is not just my story. It is a nation’s silenced truth.**
