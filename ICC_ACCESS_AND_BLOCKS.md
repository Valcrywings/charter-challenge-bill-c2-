# ICC ACCESS BARRIERS AND CANADA'S FAILURE TO ENFORCE TREATY OBLIGATIONS

While Canada is a state party to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC), **it has not implemented any direct public access or independent prosecutorial mechanisms** for human rights violations involving international treaties, directed energy weapons, or NATO-contractor crimes.

## 🚫 LEGAL BARRIERS TO JUSTICE IN CANADA

Despite its ratification of the Rome Statute in 2000 ([source](https://www.icc-cpi.int/states-parties)), Canada maintains the following legal obstructions:

- **No investigative mechanism** into NATO-aligned private contractors  
  ↳ Confirmed by [Defence Procurement Guide – Government of Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/services/doing-business-with-foreign-defence-markets/guide-navigating-nato-procurement.html)

- **Law societies restrict legal aid and representation** for:
  - Victims under national security watchlists
  - Individuals accused of conspiracy or extremism  
  ↳ Confirmed by user experience and reflected in legal literature on national security law exclusions

- **RCMP & CSIS immunity** from civil oversight  
  ↳ Not subject to Charter-based complaints per Bill C-59 and security clauses

- **Medical abuse and bio-implant denial are not investigated**  
  ↳ Canada lacks testing mechanisms for terahertz/radiofrequency exposure, as confirmed by the [Istanbul Protocol non-compliance](https://www.ohchr.org/en/publications/policy-and-methodological-publications/istanbul-protocol-manual-effective-investigation)

## ⚖️ ICC ROME STATUTE – ARTICLE 17 TRIGGERED

> **Article 17(1)(a)**: “A case is inadmissible where the State is unwilling or unable genuinely to carry out the investigation or prosecution.”

### ✅ Canada Meets ICC Trigger Conditions:

- Police do not investigate contractors, implants, DEWs
- Prosecutors deny access to discovery for torture victims
- No federal body accepts RF scan, Havana Syndrome, or unauthorized implant claims

## 📜 INTERNATIONAL TREATIES INVOKED

- [Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court](https://www.icc-cpi.int/sites/default/files/RS-Eng.pdf) (Canada ratified July 7, 2000)
- [Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms](https://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/csj-sjc/rfc-dlc/ccrf-ccdl/)
- [Canada’s Relationship with NATO](https://www.international.gc.ca/world-monde/international_relations-relations_internationales/nato-otan/index.aspx?lang=eng)
- [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights)
- [Treaty Obligations Listing](https://www.treaty-accord.gc.ca/text-texte.aspx?id=100976)

## 🧬 BILL C-2 AND SMART CONTRACT INTERFERENCE

Bill C-2 enables:
- Biometric surveillance
- Financial seizure via smart contract
- Suspension of movement or travel rights

This meets criteria for:
- Psychological torture (Article 7 of the Rome Statute)
- Gender-based persecution (targeting women)
- Denial of access to medical treatment and legal redress

## ✉️ CALL TO THE ICC PROSECUTOR

As permitted under **Article 15 of the Rome Statute**, individuals and organizations may submit evidence without state approval. This document and all related exhibits submitted through:

➡️ [GitHub: Charter Challenge to Bill C-2](https://github.com/Valcrywings/charter-challenge-bill-c2-/)

> We request a **preliminary investigation** under Article 15 for systemic crimes committed against the civilian population in Canada under NATO-aligned governance and experimental research partnerships.

## ICC Access Barriers and Canada's Treaty Failures

While Canada is a state party to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC), it **refuses to provide public access mechanisms** to uphold the treaty’s obligations. The ICC permits individuals to submit complaints (Rome Statute Article 15), but **requires either prosecutorial failure** or **evidence of systemic impunity**.

Victims of:
- Unconsented medical experimentation
- Directed energy attacks
- Surveillance-based targeting
- Genetic or biometric exploitation through smart contracts

...are **denied access to evidence, medical diagnostics, legal representation, and investigation channels**.

### Canadian Failures Include:
- **No avenue for independent investigation** into NATO-aligned private contractors.
- **Law societies block representation** for citizens labeled under security narratives.
- **Police refuse to investigate** high-level crimes under the guise of national security or partnerships.
- **No formal mechanism** for public ICC referrals, despite treaty obligations.
- Women and disabled individuals are **disproportionately affected**, especially in research, real estate seizures, and social discrediting.

---

### Why This Meets ICC Criteria:

Under **Article 17 of the Rome Statute**, the ICC has jurisdiction when a state:
- Is "unwilling or unable genuinely to carry out the investigation or prosecution."
- Uses national mechanisms to **protect perpetrators** instead of victims.

This applies directly to Canada’s practices:
- Denial of medical scans for evidence of implants.
- Suppression of court-admissible evidence of RF exposure and targeting.
- Financial gatekeeping of constitutional rights through legal cost barriers.

> This submission establishes Canada as *functionally unwilling* to prosecute or investigate crimes under ICC jurisdiction.

---

### Demand:

We call for an **Article 15 referral by the ICC Prosecutor**, supported by a **civilian-sourced legal dossier** — documenting crimes against humanity occurring on Canadian soil under false pretenses of public safety and research.
