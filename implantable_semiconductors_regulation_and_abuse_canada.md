# 🧠 Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs), Implantable Technologies & Surveillance Exploitation

## Overview

This section provides evidence and analysis of how WBANs (Wireless Body Area Networks), implantable semiconductors, and connected health systems are being deployed in Canada without sufficient ethical oversight or legal accountability. The infrastructure supports the biometric exploitation of civilians and enables real-time tracking and behavior manipulation, often under opaque private-public research partnerships.

## ⚙️ What Are WBANs?

WBANs are interconnected microelectronic systems, often implanted in or worn on the human body, that transmit physiological and behavioral data over wireless networks. These are now widely integrated in:

- **Remote healthcare monitoring**
- **Neurostimulation / neuromodulation**
- **Digital twins / biometric surveillance**
- **Embedded gaming interfaces (via Zigbee/XBee)**
- **Behavioral profiling and emotion detection**

> *These systems can also be linked to smart contracts, digital identity frameworks, and financial systems via biometric feedback loops.*
