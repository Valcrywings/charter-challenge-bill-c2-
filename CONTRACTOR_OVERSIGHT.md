# Foreign & Private Contractor Oversight in Canada

## No Public Mechanism for Civilian Investigation

Canadian citizens currently have no established mechanism to request investigations into the scope, actions, or technologies used by private military or foreign contractors operating on Canadian soil. 

This includes:
- No public list of approved technologies used (e.g., WBANs, DEWs, nanotech)
- No ability to file complaints regarding surveillance, implants, or targeting
- No oversight into whether Charter rights are being observed

## Legal Loophole: Letters of Understanding (LOUs)

Many defense or research partnerships function under Letters of Understanding (LOUs), which:
- Are **not legally binding unless a monetary exchange is made**
- Allow operations **without Parliamentary ratification or public scrutiny**
- May **authorize foreign entities to operate under their own national laws** in Canada

LOUs can enable:
- Non-consensual experimentation
- Financial asset stripping via smart contracts
- Surveillance and RF testing without legal remedy

## Are These Contractors Obeying Canadian Law?

- Many contractors **are not required to adhere to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms**
- No formal audits or independent agencies verify their compliance with **international treaties**, including:
  - The **Rome Statute of the ICC**
  - The **Convention Against Torture**
  - The **International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights**

## NATOâ€™s Legal Immunity

- **NATO is not bound by the ICC** unless its members individually submit jurisdiction
- Canada, while an ICC signatory, does not apply ICC standards to **NATO-aligned operations or joint ventures**
- Thus, foreign or Canadian nationals operating under NATO structures may **commit human rights violations without consequence**

## Call for Transparency & Oversight

We demand:
- **A public registry** of all private and foreign contractors operating under DND, RCMP, or Health Canada authority
- **An independent civilian inquiry mechanism**
- **Auditable consent and compensation mechanisms** for any citizens affected by experimental, medical, or surveillance operations
- **ICC compliance audits** for all technologies used under foreign partnerships on Canadian soil
