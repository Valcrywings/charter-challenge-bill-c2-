## II. Core Evidence Sections

### A. FINTRAC Admission – Smart Contracts Fall Outside Oversight

The Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC) has acknowledged in writing that **smart contracts fall outside its jurisdiction and oversight**. This creates a financial blind spot that enables:

- Laundering of proceeds from human experimentation
- Private research monetization on civilian data
- International offshore routing of biometric smart contracts without audit trails

This admission is **prima facie evidence** that Canadian financial authorities have no mechanisms to monitor, protect, or allow civilian opt-out of these systems. The infrastructure used is integrated into government, academic, and military research programs — making the state complicit in monetizing citizens as digital assets.
