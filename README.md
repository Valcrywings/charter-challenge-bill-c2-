# üá®üá¶ Charter Challenge to Bill C-2

This repository presents a civilian-led legal and human rights-based Charter Challenge to Canada‚Äôs Bill C-2. The bill facilitates unlawful surveillance, medical and financial discrimination, smart contract exploitation, and violations of bodily autonomy ‚Äî without transparency, informed consent, or legal accountability.

This submission reflects the voice of a widowed and disabled Canadian civilian, denied access to court, medical freedom, and economic autonomy. It exists to uphold Charter Rights, international treaties, and the sacrifices made by past generations.
