## 📖 Introduction to Bill C-2

Bill C-2, under the guise of protecting borders and modernizing financial crimes legislation, permits unchecked expansions of power including surveillance, asset control, and biometric data collection, particularly:
- During summer parliamentary breaks
- Without public awareness or debate
- Targeting economic dissidents and the medically vulnerable

## 🚨 Proven Violations

- Charter Section 7: Denial of life, liberty, and medical security
- Section 2(a): Spiritual and religious interference (biometric and neural experimentation)
- Section 15: Discrimination by economic class and technology access
- Section 8: Unlawful search and seizure via surveillance, implants, and bio-monitoring

> 💬 *“Only the wealthy now access privacy, medical defense, and Charter protections.”*

---

## ✊ Demands & Charter Claims

- No bill impacting bodily autonomy or spiritual liberty shall pass without full ethical review.
- Reverse all illegal surveillance contracts linked to biometric profiling.
- Full medical diagnostics and access to RF scans, heavy metal ion tests, and NDJD spectrum analysis.
- Legal restitution and international asylum options where rights are respected.

---

## 💸 Smart Contracts & Financial Laundering

Canada has no laws preventing:
- The creation of smart contracts tied to SIN, biometric ID, and pension data
- The laundering of billions via Legal Entity Identifiers (LEIs), DTCC, GLEIF, and CUSIPs
- Public-facing denials while FINTRAC confirms lack of jurisdiction over these mechanisms

---

## 🧬 DNA Exploitation & Genetic Sovereignty

- Canada has not ratified protections under the **Nagoya Protocol**
- Human DNA, including **Haplogroup HV0 T195C**, is used in profit-generating research without consent
- This haplogroup carries **the most known back mutations**, making it a target for rare disease and immunological research

## 🧠 Directed Energy, Implants & Medical Abuse

- Documented bilateral brain tumors ignored in Canadian medical system
- Directed energy assaults confirmed by RF scans
- Non-consensual implants show embedded Zigbee/Xbee communication nodes

## ✝️ Constitutional & Spiritual Standpoint

- DNA is the **intellectual property of God**, not governments or pharma
- The BEAST system (Bayesian Evolutionary Analysis by Sampling Trees) mirrors **Revelation references**
- Genetic harvesting without consent is **spiritual and ancestral theft**
- Bill C-2 enables **theft of covenantal identity and lineage**
