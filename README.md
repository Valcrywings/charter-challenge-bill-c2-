# 🇨🇦 Charter Challenge to Bill C-2

This repository documents a formal legal and human rights-based Charter Challenge against Canada's Bill C-2. It asserts that Bill C-2 facilitates unconstitutional targeting, financial suppression, religious discrimination, and non-consensual surveillance through unregulated smart contract infrastructure.
