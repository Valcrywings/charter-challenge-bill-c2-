# 🇨🇦 Charter Challenge to Bill C-2

This repository documents a formal Charter Challenge against **Canada's Bill C-2**, citing constitutional violations of:

- Section 7: Life, Liberty & Security of the Person  
- Section 15: Equality Under the Law  
- Section 2: Freedom of Religion, Expression & Assembly

This Bill facilitates **non-consensual surveillance**, **financial exclusion**, **religious discrimination**, and **automated governance** through **unregulated smart contract systems**. These are being developed without civilian oversight or legal recourse, silencing low-income and disabled Canadians from participation.

## ✊ Why This Challenge Matters

When only the rich can challenge legislation, **the Charter becomes null for the poor**.  
This case is not just personal — it is a voice for:

- Millions who cannot afford legal fees  
- Canadians denied medical access  
- Women and disabled citizens denied protection  
- Veterans whose legacies are dishonored

> “My grandfather served in WWII with the Princess Patricia’s Canadian Light Infantry. He was denied his military pension until age 87 and lived in poverty. Bill C-2 betrays the freedoms he fought for.”
