## 🔍 Incident Overview

Multiple Gmail access types occurred simultaneously from IP `209.29.168.92` (TELUS Communications), despite only a single device being in active use.

| Access Type        | Time      | IP Address     | Notes                                    |
|--------------------|-----------|----------------|------------------------------------------|
| Browser (Chrome)   | 1:18 AM   | 209.29.168.92  | *Current session                         |
| Mobile             | 1:18 AM   | 209.29.168.92  | Background process or cloned session     |
| OAuth Application  | 1:18 AM   | 209.29.168.92  | Tokened app access – **unnamed client**  |
| Additional Mobile  | 9:41–11:31 PM | 209.29.168.92 | Repeated background mobile hits         |

> The repeated session entries within seconds of each other are indicative of **session replay**, **token sync**, or **device cloning** through network-layer access.

## 🧠 Security Concerns

- User uses TELUS only — **not multiple ISPs**
- All access was **from one Telus IP**, yet **multiple simultaneous access types** occurred
- OAuth token in use is **not named or trusted** — could be injected or abused
- Hostname pattern (`eyrkonaeac04`) suggests internal node/session mapping — further analysis needed

---

## 🔐 Actions Taken

- Password changed and sessions forcibly revoked
- OAuth token revoked
- Forensic logging activated
- NetGuard + DNS leak tests scheduled
- Entry added to GitHub under Charter Challenge & forensic branches

---

## 🔧 Next Steps

- Audit token scope and behavior of OAuth client
- Trace hostname subdomain patterns across other logs
- Check for same IP subnet reuse by unknown devices
- Include this report in Charter Challenge and surveillance abuse dossier
