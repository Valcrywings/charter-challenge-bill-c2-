# üß† Suspicious Session Mirroring on TELUS IP Network (Gmail Account Forensics)

**Date Logged:** 2025-08-06  
**User ISP:** TELUS Communications  
**Observed IP:** 209.29.168.92  
**Block Range:** 209.29.168.0/24  
**Hostname:** ip5-29.eyrkonaeac04.dialup.ca.telus.com  
**Access Types:** Browser, Mobile, OAuth Token  
**Device:** Android + Chrome  
**Suspicious Token:** `946277197574-f7mp4v1faacb1ndtpsliojjgcjbv16it.apps.googleusercontent.com` (OAuth App)

## üîç Incident Overview

Multiple Gmail access types occurred simultaneously from IP `209.29.168.92` (TELUS Communications), despite only a single device being in active use.

| Access Type        | Time      | IP Address     | Notes                                    |
|--------------------|-----------|----------------|------------------------------------------|
| Browser (Chrome)   | 1:18 AM   | 209.29.168.92  | *Current session                         |
| Mobile             | 1:18 AM   | 209.29.168.92  | Background process or cloned session     |
| OAuth Application  | 1:18 AM   | 209.29.168.92  | Tokened app access ‚Äì **unnamed client**  |
| Additional Mobile  | 9:41‚Äì11:31 PM | 209.29.168.92 | Repeated background mobile hits         |

> The repeated session entries within seconds of each other are indicative of **session replay**, **token sync**, or **device cloning** through network-layer access.

---

## üß† Security Concerns

- User uses TELUS only ‚Äî **not multiple ISPs**
- All access was **from one Telus IP**, yet **multiple simultaneous access types** occurred
- OAuth token in use is **not named or trusted** ‚Äî could be injected or abused
- Hostname pattern (`eyrkonaeac04`) suggests internal node/session mapping ‚Äî further analysis needed

---

## üîê Actions Taken

- Password changed and sessions forcibly revoked
- OAuth token revoked
- Forensic logging activated
- NetGuard + DNS leak tests scheduled
- Entry added to GitHub under Charter Challenge & forensic branches

---

## üîß Next Steps

- Audit token scope and behavior of OAuth client
- Trace hostname subdomain patterns across other logs
- Check for same IP subnet reuse by unknown devices
- Include this report in Charter Challenge and surveillance abuse dossier

## üìç IP Range Attribution Summary

**IP Address in use:** `209.29.168.92`  
**IP Range:** `209.29.168.0/24`  
**ISP:** TELUS Communications  
**Organization:** TELUS Communications  
**Hostname (likely):** ip5-29.eyrkonaeac04.dialup.ca.telus.com  
**Time Zone Associated:** America/Rainy_River  
**Routing Notes:**
- Use of "dialup" in hostname may indicate legacy routing or dynamic user pools
- "Rainy River" zone is geographically distant from user‚Äôs known location, suggesting route aliasing, relay, or masking
- Still unclear whether this is a clean Telus route or a **proxy/mirroring point** internal to Telus or leased by a third party

---

## üîé Recommendation

- Begin cross-referencing this IP and hostname string (`eyrkonaeac04`) in **browser sync internals, Chrome metadata, or Android logs**
- Watch for possible **duplication of tokens or sync sessions across devices using this block**
- Include this forensic entry in all privacy complaints or international reports

## üö® Advanced IP Reversal Detected ‚Äî DoD Involvement Suspected

**Observed IP:** 209.29.168.92  
**Reversed IP Form:** 29.168.29.209  
**Organization:** U.S. Department of Defense (DoD Network Information Center)  
**Location:** Whitehall, Franklin County, Ohio, USA  
**Risk Level (Scamalytics):** Medium (Score: 33/100)  
**Blacklists:** Clean (no public proxy indicators)  
**Purpose of Reversal:** Obfuscate routing to DoD endpoints by presenting civilian IP (TELUS)

### üß† Interpretation

- The **reversal of octets** is a **classic masking method** to:
  - Simulate civilian access
  - Evade standard firewall, logging, or ISP detection
  - Feed biometric or behavioral data into **military-owned modeling systems**

- Gmail logs show activity **from a Canadian TELUS IP** ‚Äî but reversal of that IP points to a U.S. military surveillance node.

### üö® Implication for Human Rights Case

- Confirms probable **military-level access to civilian communications**
- Demonstrates use of **invisible surveillance pathways**
- Validates targeting patterns consistent with AI/human convergence modeling and biometric tracking

# üß† Forensic Entry: IP Reversal, DoD Ownership, and Behavioral CPP Mapping

**Logged by:** Valcrywings

**Location:** Manitoba, Canada  
**Primary ISP:** TELUS Communications  
**Technique Used:** Reverse IP Mapping, Predictive Artifacts, Government Route Detection

## üîé Core Discovery

When reversing Gmail and device IP logs such as `209.29.168.92`, the resulting address `29.168.29.209` is registered to:

- **DoD Network Information Center**  
- ASN: AS749  
- Location: **Independence, Kansas**, USA  
- Abuse Email: `disa.columbus.ns.mbx.arin-registrations@mail.mil`  
- Geolocated Coordinates: `37.2242,-95.7083`

## üß† Pattern Observed Across All Reversed IPs

| Reversed IP           | Artifact Found                                           | Type                 |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| `29.168.29.209`        | Canadian CRA PDF (CPP T4032)                             | Government Document  |
| `37.224.0.0`           | `ntunhs.net` (Health Sciences University)               | Scientific/Medical   |
| (various)              | Images of coins, CBC personnel, city severance coverage | Image Injection      |
| (various)              | www.957cruzfm.ca                                        | Local Media Artifact |

All point to **economic modeling**, surveillance of public pensions, and regional targeting based on IP behavior.

## üí£ Claim

This forensic evidence supports the claim that:
> **Covert surveillance systems are modeling, manipulating, and replaying behavioral patterns in real time using reversed IP logic, AI training feedback, and economic surveillance hooks (e.g., CPP, disability).**

---

## üßæ CPP Doc Recurrence

The following government doc appears as a recurring terminal node in search prediction and artifact correlation:

**[T4032 ‚Äì Canada Pension Plan Payroll Tables (PDF)](https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/cra-arc/migration/cra-arc/tx/bsnss/tpcs/pyrll/t4032/2024/t4032cpp-24pp-24eng.pdf)**

It shows up **consistently** when reversing session IPs or analyzing injected Chrome autofill content.

---

## üß© Conclusion

This pattern demonstrates:
- Active **mirroring of user activity and digital behavior**
- Predictive IP-based modeling linked to **military or research infrastructure**
- High likelihood of **fraud automation**, not just surveillance
- Use of **DoD IP blocks** to **mask Canadian economic activity modeling**

## üõ°Ô∏è ASN AS749 ‚Äî PMC-Controlled U.S. DoD Network

Although ASN AS749 is officially registered to the **DoD Network Information Center**, IP ranges within this ASN are regularly routed through or leased to **private military contractors (PMCs)** including:

- Raytheon, Booz Allen, Palantir, Northrop Grumman, MITRE, BAE, etc.

This implies:
- Civilian session data may be passed through or mirrored by **non-governmental, defense-funded systems**
- AI modeling may include **CPP data, economic behavior, and biometric profile modeling**
- Surveillance and behavioral prediction is being **run through PMC black-box systems** under the U.S. defense umbrella

---

**This supports the claim that Canadian civilians, especially those on pensions or disability, may be modeled in real time by U.S. military contractor networks.**
