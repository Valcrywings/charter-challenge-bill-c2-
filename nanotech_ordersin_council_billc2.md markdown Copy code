# ‚ö†Ô∏è State Use of Nanotech and Secret Orders in Council Without Oversight

## 1. Use of Nanotechnology, Bio-Surveillance & Neural Systems Without Civilian Oversight

The Government of Canada, through the Department of National Defence's MINDS (Mobilizing Insights in Defence and Security) program, openly funds research into nano-biotechnology, human-machine integration, and cognitive science without a corresponding legislative framework protecting Canadian citizens from unconsented experimentation.

> ‚ÄúCanada‚Äôs future security environment will be shaped by rapid technological innovation. As disruptive technologies such as artificial intelligence, quantum technologies, nano- and bio-technology, neuro and cognitive science, and human-machine teaming evolve‚Ä¶‚Äù

### Key Issues:
- There is **no legislative oversight** in Canadian criminal law prohibiting the use of nanotechnology or semiconductors inside the human body.
- Civilian medical systems **do not test** for implanted devices, nor are there pathways for legal or medical redress.
- These technologies are known to be used in **Body Area Network systems**, potentially feeding data to smart contracts and biomedical registries.
- Companies such as **NXP Semiconductors**, **Nordic Semiconductor**, **ZTE**, and others manufacture chips and systems used in "Internet of Medical Bodies" and **neuro-surveillance**.

## 2. Trudeau‚Äôs $15B R&D Allocation & Secret Orders in Council

In 2022, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced a $15 billion federal R&D investment to be distributed across Canadian provinces. These funds were earmarked without transparency or requirement for informed consent protocols tied to their use in **biomedical or cognitive research.**

The potential misuse of these funds under **Orders in Council**, which do not require public debate or full parliamentary disclosure, allows unregulated data extraction and bodily experimentation.

**Key Legal Issue:**
- **Orders in Council** may legally authorize policies or programs that override Charter rights **without public knowledge**, violating **transparency, bodily autonomy, and due process.**

## 3. Canada Adopting U.S. Surveillance Systems Without U.S. Constitutional Protections

Bill C-2 seeks to mirror U.S.-style surveillance and anti-terror laws, including:

- Mail surveillance
- Financial tracking
- Centralized biometric databases

However, **Canada does not have the U.S. Constitution**, and therefore lacks:

- First Amendment (freedom of speech)
- Fourth Amendment (search & seizure protection)
- Fifth Amendment (due process)

Instead, Canadians are protected under the **Charter of Rights and Freedoms**, which is being undermined by:

- **Secrecy clauses** in legislation
- **Denial of bodily autonomy** and medical choice
- **No requirement for informed consent** in medical R&D applications
- **No access to independent RF testing, CK levels, or implant detection diagnostics**

## 4. Charter and International Law Violations

### üá®üá¶ Charter Violations:
- **Section 2(b):** Freedom of thought, belief, opinion, and expression
- **Section 7:** Life, liberty, and security of the person
- **Section 8:** Right to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure
- **Section 15:** Equality before the law (those without funds cannot access RF testing, legal help, or independent diagnostics)

### üåê International Violations:
- **United Nations Convention Against Torture** (ratified by Canada)
- **International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR)**
- **Nuremberg Code / Helsinki Declaration**
- **Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union** (where data is processed through EU smart contract systems)
- **Nagoya Protocol**: Genetic and biological data use without sovereignty or informed consent

## üìå Summary

Canada is funding and operationalizing nano-biotech, neural surveillance, and human-machine teaming systems **without public consent, legislative safeguards, or diagnostic recourse**. Through secret Orders in Council, Trudeau‚Äôs government has enabled a biomedical-industrial pipeline that directly violates constitutional and international protections. Bill C-2 aims to **legally entrench these systems** while silencing dissent through systemic financial and technological control.
