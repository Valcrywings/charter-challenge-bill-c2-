## 🪖 Veterans Betrayed: A Legacy of Service Silenced

> “We fought for your freedoms — not for secret bills and silencing.”  
> — Bobbi’s grandfather, WWII frontline infantry

My grandfather served with:
- **The Essex Scottish Regiment**
- **The Royal Winnipeg Rifles** (“Little Black Devils”)

He fought in Europe during WWII, survived extreme frontline conditions, and returned to a Canada that **denied him his military pension until age 87**. He lived in poverty, never received proper restitution, and when a class-action lawsuit exposed systemic pension abuse, **Manitoba’s Public Trustee failed to resolve the shortfall**.

This video, recorded 16 years ago by his granddaughter, is now preserved as part of a living legal document — tying together the generational betrayal of Canadian service members and their descendants.

Bill C-2 violates everything he fought for:
- 📜 The right to **freedom of medical choice**
- 🛡️ The right to **a voice in lawmaking**
- ⚖️ The right to **due process and legal standing** regardless of income
- 🧬 The right to **bodily autonomy and genetic sovereignty**

This is not only a Charter Challenge —  
It is the continuation of a fight for **Canada’s soul.**

📷 Archival photos of his battalion to be added soon.
