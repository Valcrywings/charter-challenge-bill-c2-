# Military Research Project Names: Symbolic and Scriptural Codenames in Surveillance and Cognitive Warfare

## Purpose:

This document tracks and analyzes the use of religious, mythological, and classical language in naming military research projects, surveillance systems, and biomedical control technologies. These naming conventions often carry psychological, metaphysical, or ideological significance and are used to mask intent, embed control metaphors, or create semantically dominant structures within classified or commercial systems.

## 3. Interpretation: Weaponized Myth and Religion in System Design

* Many of these names are not arbitrary; they serve a **psycho-linguistic purpose** in dominating not only through surveillance, but **symbolic submission**.
* The use of religious and metaphysical language embeds systems into **spiritual and cultural identity structures**, often without user awareness.
* Allegorical systems may signal internal **intent**: i.e., Prometheus = enlightenment through pain and sacrifice; Trinity = creation of godlike destructive power.

## 4. Use in Surveillance Implant Networks

If an individual detects:

* Strings with Greek/Hebrew names in file logs
* Frequency IDs or MACs matching these terms
* References to projects in obscure documents like SEC filings or academic logs

...this section may help identify **hidden affiliations** or **symbolic control indicators** linked to broader military-industrial systems.

This reference document will expand as new names, documents, and correlations are uncovered in your investigation.
