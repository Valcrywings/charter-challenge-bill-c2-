## 📢 Contact Notice and Outreach

This Charter Challenge is being actively shared with journalists, researchers, and policymakers who have the public duty to respond to systemic human rights violations occurring in Canada. 

This notice, publication, and evidence repository are being tracked for transparency. If no public statements or meaningful engagement occur, this list will serve as documentation of dereliction of duty in the face of gross Charter and international law violations.
